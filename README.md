# System Requirements
MATLAB r2023b and Python 4.3.0 were used in this work. MATLAB is open source and free to use for enrolled students at many educational institutes, or available for purchase. Python is free and open source. Following information details the requirements to run these packages. Python is in general backwards compatible but individual packages may vary in their backwards capibilities. If possible, use versions provided or later, unless major software updates are described in external documentation. 
## Hardware 
All testing in this work was performed on a machine using an M1 processing chip and 16GB available RAM. Compatible, yet untested hardware requirements are listed below.
### MATLAB
RAM: 4GB minimum, 8GB or greater recommended

Processor: 1.8Ghz minimum, faster is preferred. arm support needed.

Disk Space: ~6GB minimum for installation

### Python
RAM: 2GB minimum, 4GB or greater recommended

Processor: any 64-bit arm supported processor compatable with Operating System

Disk Space: ~100MB for installation, not including other required packages

### Total
Roughly 10 GB RAM, using an arm supported processor, and ample disk space > ~6GB is required/recommended to install and use MATLAB and Python (+ packages and dependencies) in this work.
